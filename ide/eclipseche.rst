Eclipse Che
===========

`Eclipse Che <https://www.eclipse.org/che/>`_ is an open-source Java based
developer workspace server and cloud integrated development environment (IDE)
which provides a remote development platform for multi-user purpose. The
workspace server comes with a RESTful webservice and provides high flexibility.
It also contains a SDK which can be used to create plug-ins for languages,
frameworks or tools.

.. note::

    1. Please make sure to read :ref:`pioremote` guide first.
    2. You need :ref:`pioaccount` if you don't have it. Registration is FREE.
    3. You should have a running :ref:`cmd_remote_agent` on a remote machine
       where hardware devices are connected physically or accessible for the
       remote operations. See **PIO Remote** :ref:`pio_remote_quickstart` for details.

Integration
-----------

1.  `Sign in to Codenvy (based on Eclipse Che) <https://codenvy.com>`_. A
    registration is FREE and gives you unlimited private projects.

2.  Open `Workspaces <https://codenvy.io/dashboard/#/workspaces>`_ tab

3.  Click on "Add Workspace", then switch to "Runtime" tab.

    * **Name** set to "PlatformIO"
    * **Stack** search for ``PLATFORMIO``
    * Click on "Create" button, then "Open".

4.  Using opened Terminal, please log in to :ref:`pioaccount` using
    :ref:`cmd_account_login` command.


Quick Start
-----------

Let's create our first PlatformIO-based Codenvy Project

1.  Click on ``Menu: Workspace > Create New Project`` and select
    ``platformio-arduino-blink`` sample. Set "Name" to "Arduino Blink" and
    press "Create".

2.  Now you can use dropdown Commands menu and process project with "run" command

.. image:: ../_static/images/ide/eclipseche/ide-eclipseche-run-project.png


3.  If you prefer to work with :ref:`piocore` CLI, then you can process project
    using Cloud IDE Terminal and the next commands:

    * :ref:`cmd_run` - build project locally (using Cloud IDE's virtual machine)
    * :ref:`pio run -t clean <cmd_run>` - clean project
    * :ref:`pio remote run -t upload <cmd_remote_run>` - upload firmware (program) to a remote device
    * :ref:`cmd_remote_device_list` - list available remote devices
    * :ref:`cmd_remote_device_monitor` - Remote Serial Port Monitor


Multi-Project workspace
-----------------------

You can have multiple PlatformIO-based Projects in the same workspace. We
recommend a next folders structure:

.. code::

    ├── project-A
    │   ├── lib
    │   │   └── README
    │   ├── platformio.ini
    │   └── src
    │       └── main.ino
    └── project-B
        ├── lib
        │   └── README
        ├── platformio.ini
        └── src
            ├── main.cpp
            └── main.h

In this case, you need to use ``-d, --project-dir`` option for :ref:`cmd_run`
or :ref:`cmd_remote_run` commands:

* ``pio remote run --project-dir project-A -t upload`` build Project-A
* ``pio remote run --project-dir project-A -t upload`` remote firmware uploading
    using Project-A
* ``pio remote run -d project-B -t upload`` remote firmware (program) uploading
    using Project-B

See documentation for :option:`platformio remote run --project-dir` option.
