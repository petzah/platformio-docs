Drone
=====

`Drone <https://drone.io>`_  is a hosted continuous integration service.
It enables you to conveniently set up projects to automatically build, test,
and deploy as you make changes to your code to
`GitHub <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub>`_ and
`BitBucket <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket>`_ repositories.

Drone is configured by modifying settings in your project control panel.

Drone automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a
repository that is using Drone, and each time this happens, it will
try to build the project using :ref:`cmd_ci` command. This includes commits to
all branches, not just to the master branch. Drone will also build and run
pull requests. When that process has completed, it will notify a developer in
the way it has been configured to do so â€” for example, by sending an email
containing the build results (showing success or failure). It can be
configured to build project on a range of different :ref:`platforms`.
